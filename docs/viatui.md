After initializing turbo-src

```
docker-compose run viatui
```

You don't start turbo-src to use it, necessarily. But this may change if it's ran in conjuction with tests.

You can check the screenshots in `chromium-nix-screenshots`, which is a series of screenshots tracking it's progress with the extension. You can look at `scripts/container_screenshots.py`to see what steps its taking.
