# Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Can you apply all your voting power to multiple open pull requests.

Yes. Contributors need not worry about saving up voting power.

### 2. Does a token allow you to vote on a repo?

No. Tokens are per repo.

### 3. Can you vote on more than one pull request at a time.

Yes, sort of. There can only be one ***active*** pull request vote a time. Such pull requests received votes exceeding some threshold, say 10%. Once one goes active, the other votes are suspended - resuming once complete if there are no new potential merge conflicts.
